# Drum-Kit
Here's a project named Drum Kit which plays different sounds after pressing keys in keyboard or even when clicked on screen.
I hope you liked it.
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project using Document Object Manipulation. 
This is a github pages link to run this project:- https://umanghere.github.io/Drum-Kit/
